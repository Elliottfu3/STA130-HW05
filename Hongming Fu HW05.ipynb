    "In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis (H₀) assumes that there is no significant effect, difference, or relationship in the research object, and the alternative hypothesis (H₁) assumes that there is an effect or difference. The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis through data analysis. Testable ideas need to meet two key conditions: one is measurable, and the other is falsifiable, which means that the idea must be able to be quantitatively evaluated through data and it is possible to prove it wrong by analyzing the data. A good null hypothesis should be clear and specific, and assume a state of \"no effect\" or \"no difference\". When designing the null hypothesis, make sure it can be tested through statistical data, so that it is scientifically determined whether the hypothesis can be rejected and the research conclusions can be drawn.\n",

    "**Question 2**\n",
    "In statistical testing, we typically draw a sample from a larger population and analyze the sample data to infer the characteristics of the population. The data points in the sample (like \\( x_i \\)) are used to calculate sample statistics, such as the sample mean μ , which helps us estimate the parameters of the population. The true mean of the population μ0 is the main focus of interest, but we usually do not know its exact value.\n",
    "Therefore, the primary goal of statistical tests is to use information from the sample to infer whether the population parameter is consistent with our assumptions. For example, in hypothesis testing, we compare the sample data to the hypothesized population mean μ0 to determine whether the sample provides sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This means that while we analyze the sample data, the real focus is on making inferences about the population’s true characteristics, not just drawing conclusions about the sample itself.\n",
    "Thus, the outcome of statistical tests is centered on the population parameter rather than the sample statistic. This process ensures that we can make reasonable inferences about a larger population or phenomenon based on limited sample data.\n",
